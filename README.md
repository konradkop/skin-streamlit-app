# Skin Cancer Melanoma Detection App

This is the **Streamlit** portion of a skin cancer melanoma app developed in collaboration with **Kaitlyn (Shengping) Ka**. 

The app leverages the **HAM10000 dataset** and our custom model to **detect and classify various skin lesions**.

## Features
- Upload images of skin lesions
- Detect presence of melanoma or other skin lesion types
- Classify lesions using a trained machine learning model
- Interactive Streamlit interface for easy use

## Dataset
- **HAM10000**: A large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions.
